# PSLViz

A repo containing a project that aims to visualize PSL in a user-friendly and helpful way.

To use, first generate a data file using the `-viz`/`--visualization` option in the PSL CLI.
(Until this feature is merged into the main PSL repository, use the `psl_viz` branch of this fork:
[https://github.com/AaronRodden/psl](https://github.com/AaronRodden/psl/tree/psl_viz).

Then, visit [linqs.github.io/psl-vmi/](https://linqs.github.io/psl-vmi/) and upload the data file.
